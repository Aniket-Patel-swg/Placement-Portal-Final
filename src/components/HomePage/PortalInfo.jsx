      When in a university, a student has to build his or her resume right from scratch. The course a student gets admitted in takes care of the fundamental knowledge required to develop that particular skill. Basically, this is taken care of by the academics taught at the institution. But, in today’s world, that alone is not enough. In the current market, many internships are available for students to enroll in, which helps them to strengthen their own profile.
