                  aptitude test which has questions on Mathematics, English &
                  Reasoning. Some companies also have technical questions in the
                  test. Many companies also started taking coding and written
                  ability test. After written test, the companies conduct
                  interview round for those candidates who qualify the written
                  test. Interview round may have combined or separate HR &
                  technical interviews. Few companies in addition to this also
                  conduct personality or psychometric test.
